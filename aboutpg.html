            <p>I'm Gowtham Palanisamy, a dedicated student pursuing a B.E. in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology. My journey in technology has been fueled by a passion for learning and a drive to apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems.

            With hands-on experience in machine learning projects like House Price Prediction and Iris Classification, and a strong foundation in Python, Pandas, and MongoDB, I've developed a skill set that I'm eager to expand upon. My internships have provided me with practical insights and the ability to tackle complex challenges, particularly in the fields of data science and software development.
            
            My achievements, including winning at the zonal level in both football and other competitions, and excelling in sports like gymnastics, reflect my commitment to excellence and my ability to balance academics with extracurricular activities. Iâ€™m also an avid learner outside the classroom, with hobbies in drawing, music, and art and craft that keep my creativity thriving.
            
            As I continue my journey, I aim to further my expertise in machine learning and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact. I'm always excited to learn new things, embrace challenges, and grow both personally and professionally.
